## Health

The foremost consumption, which we can better call an investment, I think it's health. The health investment includes mental health and physical health.  
I've got a feeling that sometimes when I go home from work, I can't get my mind out of the working status rapidly. So all the stuff that makes us energetic every day is worth purchasing.  
A latex pillow, a noise-canceling headset, they are all good for us to have a rest.  
Also, if we think a yoga mat is good for us to immerse ourselves into meditation, we can purchase that.  
By the way, we should notice that it doesn't mean that we've formed a habit when we own the tools.

## Knowledge

There's a proverb, "Books are the windows to the world." That's absolutely correct.  
But nowadays, there are some other convenient ways for us to broaden our horizons and open up our minds.  
Online courses are convenient for us to learn new subjects, i.e., Coursera and Udemy.  
I think they're much better than YouTube because we must concentrate on the lecture and there are homework and quizzes for us to review what we learned in the lesson. These are important for us to absorb the knowledge.  
Besides, it's valuable to pay for a trip to a new city or new country. We'll always meet new person and absorb new culture in a trip, that's also a way of learning.

## Time-saving

Last but not least, it's about time-saving.  
I remembered a thought in an article, that we pay twice for each thing we purchase.  
Sometimes before I buy something, I spend time looking for the lowest historical price, and then spend additional attention on the news to see if the price was reduced today. Even if I bought it at a lower price in the end, I lose the time of my attention. So in my mind, it's worth paying a little more for the time-saving.  
There's another similar thing: there were a lot of pirated games and software in my country when I was a child. So I got used to finding a pirated one when a new game was released. Sometimes it takes a really long time and the download speed is very slow, which also decreases my passion. At last, the origin of satisfaction comes from finding a pirated game version instead of enjoying the story in the game. That's not good for the developers and also for me.  
In my mind, it's not worth spending time on things that distract from our main goal. It seems that we spend a little more money on the surface, but it improves our concentration and helps us just enjoy today's life.
