## Health

The formost consumption, which we can better call it the investment,
I think it's health.The health investment include the mental health and physical health.  
I've got a feeling that sometimes when I go home from work, I cann't get my mind out of the 
working status rapidly.So all the stuff that make you have energetic everyday is deserved to purchase.
A latex pillow, a noise-canceling headset, they are all good for you to have a rest.  
Aslo if you think a yoga mat is good for you to immerse yourself into a medition, just purchase it.

## Knowledge

There's a proverb, "the books are the stairs to the success".That's absolutely correct.
But Nowadays, there are some other convenient way for us to broden our horizon, open up our mind.
The online course is convenient for us to acknowledge new subject, i.e. Coursera and Udemy.  
I think they're much better than youtube because you must be concentrate on the lecture and there are homework and quiz for you to review what you learned this lesson.These are import for you to absorb the knowledge.  
Besides, it valuable to purchase for a trip to a new city or new county, I found that there are always some similar traditional practise in different countries, they are just expressed in difference ways.

## Time-saving

The last but not the least, it's about time saving.  
I remembered a thought in an article, that you pay twice for each stuff you purchased.
Sometimes before I bought something, I paid time to look for the lowest history price, and then spend addtional attention on the news that if the price was reduction today.Even I bought it with a lower price in the end, but I lose the time of my attention.So in my mind, it's deserved to pay a little more expensive for the the time-saving.  
There's another similar thing, there're a lot of pirate games and softwares in my country when I was a child.So I get used to find pirate one when a new game wes released.Sometimes it takes really long time and download speed is very slow, this also decrease my passion. At last the origin of satisfaction comes from a pirate game version was found instead of enjoying the story in the game.That's not good for the developers and also me.  
In my mind, it's not deserved to spend time on the stuff that distract your main goal, It seems that your spend money a little expensive currently, but it improves your concentration and help you just enjoy the nowdays life.
