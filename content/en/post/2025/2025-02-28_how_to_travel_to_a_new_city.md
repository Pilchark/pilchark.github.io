## 1. Safety First

No matter where you go, you should always remember the most important thing is our personal safety.
If you travel to a country that the gun is legal by law, you may take a research to avoid somewhere dangerous, the slum or the distrcit in the warzone.
What's more, it's not only about the personal safety. If you go to a city which the climate is totaly different with your city, Beware of heatstroke or get cold. If you try to take a hiking far away from the city center, make sure the battery power of you cell-phone is enough, or just take a non-smart phones for backup, if there's emeregency situation that you want to call 911.

## 2. Go to somewhere not popular

When people talk about the some modern cities in the world, they always predict a place. The Big Ben in London, Statue of Liberty in US, Eiffel Tower in France, that makes sense.But if you'd like to find out the life style, the secret of the city which can't be directly saw by your eyes, you could go to the market for a breakfast. Observe the cleaners, the ministore owners, the elder people in the parks, they just tell you the feelings of this city in a implicit way.

## 3. Make one goal and only one.

The office workers don't have much vacations, so they will go to as many attractions as possible.There's saying in Chinese to describe these people, 'The Navy SEALs Travelers'. People got a anxious feeling ff they didn't visit all the places on the to-do list.

There's one solution, make a formost goal before your trip, and pay all of your attention to it, when you finished that means you achieved your trip successfully.If you still have time left to visit other attractions, those are bonus for you.
