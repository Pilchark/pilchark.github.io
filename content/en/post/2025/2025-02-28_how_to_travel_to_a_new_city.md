## 1. Safety First

Personal safety should always be your top priority, no matter where you travel. If you're visiting a country where firearms are legal, research ahead to avoid dangerous areas, slums, or conflict zones. 

Safety isn't just about avoiding crime. When traveling to places with different climates from your home, be mindful of health risks like heatstroke or extreme cold. If you're planning activities like hiking away from city centers, ensure your phone is fully charged and consider carrying a backup phone for emergencies. Having a way to contact emergency services (like 911) could be crucial.

## 2. Explore Off the Beaten Path

When people think of major world cities, they often focus on famous landmarks - London's Big Ben, New York's Statue of Liberty, or Paris's Eiffel Tower. While these are impressive, they don't tell the whole story. To truly understand a city's lifestyle and hidden character, venture into local markets for breakfast, observe the daily routines of street cleaners, chat with small shop owners, or watch elderly residents in parks. These authentic experiences reveal the city's true spirit in ways that tourist attractions can't.

## 3. Focus on One Main Goal

Many office workers, with their limited vacation time, try to pack too many attractions into their itinerary. In China, these rushed tourists are jokingly called "Navy SEAL Travelers." This approach often leads to anxiety about completing a lengthy to-do list rather than enjoying the experience.

Instead, set one primary goal for your trip and focus on achieving it. Consider everything else a bonus. This approach helps you fully appreciate your chosen experience without the stress of rushing through multiple attractions. Once you've accomplished your main goal, you can relax and explore other sites if time permits.
