leetcode 930: Binary Subarrays With Sum

Given a binary array nums and an integer goal, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum goal.

A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,0,0,0], goal = 0
Output: 15

1. 
if cur sums = goal:
  all_sums = prefix_sums + 1
else:
  all_sums = prefix_sums

2. prefix sums array are [1,0] and [0,1]

The previous prefix sum would <=3

1. 2-2=0,so from the beginning to current prefix sum we nned find;
2. 3-2=1, so there are two type of prefix we should notice,first is prefix<=2, second is prefix from 1 to 3.

1. When we're at prefix sum 3, two position has prefix sum 1
2. When we're at prefix sum 2, 0 position has prefix sum 0

```python
def numSubarrays(nums, goal):
    # Initialize variables
    # prefix_sum starts at 0
    # create a hashmap to store count of prefix sums
    
    # iterate through nums
        # update prefix_sum
        # if (prefix_sum - goal) exists in hashmap, add to result
        # update hashmap with current prefix_sum
```

> Would you like to try filling in this structure?


```py
def numSubarrays(nums, goal):
    # Initialize variables
    prefix_sum = []
    sum = 0
    # prefix_sum starts at 0
    for i in nums:
        sum+=i
        prefix_sum.append(sum)
    
    # create a hashmap to store count of prefix sums
    hash_map = {}
    for i in prefix_sum:
        if i not in hash_map:
            hash_map[i] = 1
        hash_map[i] += 1
    
    # iterate through nums
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(prefix_sum)-1, -1,-1):
        # update prefix_sum
        # if (prefix_sum - goal) exists in hashmap, add to result
        if (prefix_sum[i] - goal) in hash_map:
            result += hash_map[prefix_sum[i] - goal]
        # update hashmap with current prefix_sum
    return result
```

> Let's modify the approach to count as we go. Here's a structure:

```python
def numSubarrays(nums, goal):
    curr_sum = 0
    count = {0: 1}  # Why do you think we initialize with {0: 1}?
    result = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        # Update curr_sum
        # Check if (curr_sum - goal) exists in count
        # Update count with current curr_sum
```

> Can you:

> 2. Try completing this modified version?
> 

Yes, the first index of the arr is 1, and index start from 0,
so we initialize with {0:1}

the modified code
```python
def numSubarrays(nums, goal):
    curr_sum = 0
    count = {0: 1}  # Why do you think we initialize with {0: 1}?
    result = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        # Update curr_sum
        curr_sum += num
        if curr_sum in count.keys():
            count[curr_sum] += 1
        else:
            count[curr_sum] = 1
        # Check if (curr_sum - goal) exists in count
        if (curr_sum - goal) in count.keys():
        # Update count with current curr_sum
            result +=  count[curr_sum]
```

I noticed that, thanks.
```python
def numSubarrays(nums, goal):
    curr_sum = 0
    count = {0: 1}  # Why do you think we initialize with {0: 1}?
    result = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        # Update curr_sum
        curr_sum += num
        if curr_sum in count.keys():
            count[curr_sum] += 1
        else:
            count[curr_sum] = 1
        # Check if (curr_sum - goal) exists in count
        if (curr_sum - goal) in count.keys():
        # Update count with current curr_sum
            result += count[curr_sum - goal]
```


There is a situation not passed.
[0,0,0,0,0]
should return 15


> I see the issue in your code. The problem is in how you're updating the count dictionary and calculating the result. Let's fix it:
> 
> The main issue is that you're first updating the count for the current sum and then checking if (curr_sum - goal) exists, which means you're counting the current subarray twice when curr_sum - goal equals curr_sum (happens when goal = 0).

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def numSubarraysWithSum(self, nums: List[int], goal: int) -> int:
    curr_sum = 0
    count = {0: 1}  # Initialize with {0: 1} to count subarrays starting from index 0
    result = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        # Update curr_sum
        curr_sum += num
        
        # Check if (curr_sum - goal) exists in count
        # This finds all previous positions where a subarray of sum 'goal' ends at current position
        if (curr_sum - goal) in count:
            result += count[curr_sum - goal]
        
        # Update count with current curr_sum
        # This tracks the number of times we've seen each prefix sum
        count[curr_sum] = count.get(curr_sum, 0) + 1
    
    return result
```

The key changes are:
1. First check if (curr_sum - goal) exists before updating the count
2. Use count.get(curr_sum, 0) + 1 for cleaner code instead of checking if key exists
3. Removed redundant .keys() calls when checking dictionary keys

This approach correctly counts the number of subarrays with sum equal to the goal, including when the goal is 0 (as in the [0,0,0,0,0] test case).

For the [0,0,0,0,0] example with goal=0:
- We find all subarrays that have a sum of 0
- This includes subarrays of all possible lengths (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Total: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 subarrays

final:

```py
def numSubarraysWithSum(self, nums: List[int], goal: int) -> int:
    curr_sum = 0
    count = {0: 1}  # Initialize with {0: 1} to count subarrays starting from index 0
    result = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        # Update curr_sum
        curr_sum += num
        
        # Check if (curr_sum - goal) exists in count
        # This finds all previous positions where a subarray of sum 'goal' ends at current position
        if (curr_sum - goal) in count:
            result += count[curr_sum - goal]
        
        # Update count with current curr_sum
        # This tracks the number of times we've seen each prefix sum
        count[curr_sum] = count.get(curr_sum, 0) + 1
    
    return result
```
